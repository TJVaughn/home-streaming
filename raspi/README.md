# Raspberry Pi Config

- after flashing sd with raspian headless
- (insert commands to add wifi config)
- (insert commands to add on-reboot.sh)
- (insert commands to make it executable and run on start)
- (see if you can add those to the sd before even starting it)
- (day 1, try to have it just get the new install, then immediately run on start)
